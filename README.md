# 1MB Redstone Disabler
Made by zivthemagniv for one of my 1MB networked servers; BuildingKingdoms.com. 

This little plugin lets you quickly disable a wide variety of redstone elements on a Paper Minecraft 1.21.4+ server and the `config.yml` changes can be reloaded with `/redstonedisabler reload`

## Configuration YAML 
```yaml
x
```

## Commands
```
/redstonedisabler reload
```

## Permissions
```
redstonedisabler.reload
```
(default: op)
Example: lp group default permission set redstonedisabler.reload false
Example: lp group owner permission set redstonedisabler.reload true

## Installation
- Put in `~/plugins/` folder, and start the server
- Go through config.yml and set your preferences
- `/redstonedisabler reload`
- Test it .. 

## Idea / Credits
I guess me, though nothing new here.. just needed a solution to a problem on a server and couldn't find a working 1.21.4+ release. Code created by zivthemagniv (spigotmc username)
